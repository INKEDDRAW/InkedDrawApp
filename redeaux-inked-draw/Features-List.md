## **Features List**

### **Authentication & User Onboarding**

#### **User Registration, Verification & Profiling**

* **User Stories:**  
  * As a **New User**, I want to sign up with one click using my Apple or Google account so I can minimize friction and get started immediately.  
  * As a **Security-Conscious User**, I want to go through a robust, multi-step age verification process so I have confidence that the community is exclusively for adults.  
  * As a **Connoisseur**, I want to select my initial taste preferences through a guided, visual experience so the app can immediately begin tailoring its recommendations to my palate.  
  * As a **Community Member**, I want to build a profile with my name, bio, and avatar so I can craft my personal brand within the Inked Draw community.  
* **UX/UI Considerations:**  
  * **Core Experience:**  
    * The registration screen will be minimal, emphasizing the "Sign in with Apple/Google" options over traditional email/password to encourage a quick, secure start.  
    * Age verification will be presented as a professional, necessary step. The UI will show clear progress (e.g., "Step 1 of 2: Verifying ID") with smooth, animated transitions between states (uploading, processing, success/failure). A loading state will feature a subtle, brand-aligned animation, not a generic spinner.  
    * The taste preference selector will be a highly interactive, full-screen experience. Instead of dropdowns, users will tap on beautifully designed cards representing wine regions, beer styles, or cigar flavor profiles. Selections will confirm with a subtle haptic buzz and scaling animation.  
  * **Advanced Users & Edge Cases:**  
    * If age verification fails, the UI will present a clear, helpful error message with a direct link to a support channel, avoiding a frustrating dead end.  
    * The entire onboarding flow can be skipped and returned to later via a persistent but unobtrusive banner on the main feed, respecting the user's time.  
    * Profile creation will feature real-time username validation and an avatar upload tool with a built-in cropping interface.

### **Collection Management (Connoisseur's Compendium)**

#### **Offline-First Collection & Item Management**

* **User Stories:**  
  * As a **Collector**, I want to add a new wine to my cellar by filling out a detailed form, so my digital record is as meticulous as my physical one.  
  * As an **Organizer**, I want to access and edit my entire cigar collection while I'm in my walk-in humidor with no cell service, so I can manage my inventory on the spot.  
  * As a **Data Enthusiast**, I want to see a clear "Syncing..." status when I regain connectivity, so I have confidence that my offline changes are being saved to the cloud.  
* **UX/UI Considerations:**  
  * **Core Experience:**  
    * The "Add Item" screen will use **progressive disclosure**. The most critical fields (e.g., Name, Brand) will be presented first. Tapping "Add More Details" will smoothly expand the form to reveal more granular fields (Wrapper, Vintage, etc.), preventing user overload.  
    * A persistent, subtle icon in the header (e.g., a cloud icon) will clearly indicate the app's connection status. Tapping it will show a more detailed sync status modal.  
    * When offline, UI elements for online-only features (like the social feed) will be gracefully hidden or replaced with a clear message, while the "My Collection" tab remains fully interactive.  
  * **Advanced Users & Edge Cases:**  
    * When a sync conflict occurs (e.g., an item was edited on two devices while offline), the UI will present a simple, clear conflict resolution screen, showing both versions side-by-side and allowing the user to choose which to keep.  
    * The UI for each collection (Humidor, Cellar, Log) will have a distinct but cohesive theme (e.g., subtle color palette and iconography changes) to aid in contextual awareness.  
    * Lists will feature physics-based scrolling and subtle stagger animations when items are sorted or filtered, making the interface feel alive and responsive.

### **Social & Community (Curated Social Salon)**

#### **Real-Time Feed & Interaction**

* **User Stories:**  
  * As a **Sharer**, I want to tag a specific, verified whiskey from the app's database in my post so my followers know exactly what I'm enjoying.  
  * As a **Learner**, I want to see new comments appear on a post I'm viewing in real-time, without needing to refresh, so I can participate in a live discussion.  
  * As a **Community Member**, I want to receive an immediate, native push notification when an expert I follow replies to my comment so I don't miss the opportunity to engage.  
* **UX/UI Considerations:**  
  * **Core Experience:**  
    * The feed will utilize a high-contrast, editorial layout with generous whitespace, prioritizing high-resolution imagery and elegant typography.  
    * New posts and comments arriving in real-time will animate in gracefully from the top of the view, rather than just appearing abruptly. A small notification pill "New Post" might appear first, allowing the user to reveal the new content with a tap.  
    * The "Appreciate" button will have a unique, satisfying micro-interaction, perhaps a subtle burst of particles or a fluid animation that reinforces the premium brand.  
  * **Advanced Users & Edge Cases:**  
    * When creating a post, tagging an item will open a powerful search modal that allows the user to quickly find and select a product from the "Golden Record" database.  
    * The feed will employ virtualization to ensure smooth scrolling performance even with thousands of posts.  
    * Content flagged by the proactive AI moderation system will be instantly blurred in the UI for all users, with a "Under Review" notice, pending human moderator action.

### **Discovery & Recommendations**

#### **Content-Based AI Suggestions**

* **User Stories:**  
  * As an **Explorer**, I want the app to suggest a new cigar for me based on the specific flavor profiles (e.g., "leathery," "cocoa") of the cigars I've already rated highly, so I can discover new things that match my palate.  
  * As a **User**, I want my recommendations to be presented with a clear explanation of *why* they were suggested, so I can build trust in the AI's intelligence.  
* **UX/UI Considerations:**  
  * **Core Experience:**  
    * Recommendations will not be presented like ads. They will be woven into the user experience in dedicated UI components, such as a "Discover" section on the home feed or a "You Might Also Enjoy" carousel on an item's detail page.  
    * Each recommendation will be accompanied by a concise, human-readable reason (e.g., "Because you appreciate the peppery notes in the Padr√≥n 1964...").  
    * The user will be able to provide feedback on recommendations ("Not Interested" or "Add to Wishlist"), which will immediately and visibly influence future suggestions, creating a responsive feedback loop.  
  * **Advanced Users & Edge Cases:**  
    * In the settings, power users can fine-tune their recommendation engine, adjusting the weight of certain attributes or excluding specific brands/regions from suggestions.  
    * If the AI doesn't have enough data to make a confident recommendation, the UI won't show a poor one. Instead, it will display a beautifully designed empty state encouraging the user to rate more items to "unlock personalized suggestions."
