BRAND PERSONALITY PICKER - COMPREHENSIVE TEMPLATE
PRIMARY TONE IDENTITY (Pick 1-2)

[x] Professional - Competent, trustworthy, business-focused

[x] Confident - Bold, decisive, authoritative

Rationale: The target audience consists of operators and entrepreneurs who value results. The tone must be as competent and reliable as the tools they use daily. It's a B2B product for a B2C problem, requiring an authoritative yet empowering voice.

FORMALITY LEVEL (Pick 1)

[x] Professional Casual - "Hello", some contractions, balanced

Rationale: The user is a tech-native professional. The tone should be respectful of their position ("Professional") but modern and efficient ("Casual"). We avoid overly formal language but also steer clear of slang or excessive friendliness.

EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION (Pick 1-2)

[x] Calm - Even-keeled, steady, reassuring language

[x] Realistic - Honest, direct, expectations-setting

Rationale: The app's core function is restriction, which can be a negative experience. A calm, steady tone makes the intervention feel like a controlled, intentional state, not a punishment. The realism is crucial for building trust with a data-driven audience.

USER ADDRESSING STYLE (Pick 1)

[x] Direct Personal - "You", "Your", individual focus

Rationale: This is a tool for personal productivity and achievement. The focus must be on the user's goals, their metrics, and their progress. The language should reflect a direct report on their performance.

CONFIDENCE LEVEL (Pick 1)

[x] Confident - Clear direction, "can", "will help you"

Rationale: The app is a partner in the user's success. It needs to speak with confidence about the value it provides ("This will help you save...") without being arrogant or making unprovable claims ("guaranteed").

SENTENCE STRUCTURE (Pick 1-2)

[x] Short & Punchy - 3-7 words, fragments okay, impact-focused

[x] Bullet Efficient - List format, scannable, action-oriented

Rationale: Entrepreneurs are time-poor and information-dense. The copy must be highly scannable and deliver insights with maximum efficiency. Headlines and CTAs are short; data is presented in lists.

WORD CHOICE PATTERNS (Pick 2-3)

[x] Simple & Clear - Common words, avoid jargon, accessible language

[x] Premium - "Craft", "Curate", "Elevate", "Enhance", high-value terms

[x] Problem-Solving - "Fix", "Solve", "Resolve", "Handle", solution-oriented

Rationale: The language combines Stripe-level clarity with the premium feel of a "private briefing." We solve problems using sophisticated, high-value language that respects the user's intelligence.

ERROR & FAILURE HANDLING (Pick 1)

[x] Solution-Focused - Skip apology, jump to fix, forward-looking

Rationale: This audience values solutions, not apologies. If something goes wrong, the copy should immediately guide them to the resolution with clear, actionable steps.

SUCCESS & CELEBRATION (Pick 1)

[x] Achievement Recognition - "Milestone reached", "Progress made", accomplishment

Rationale: Success isn't celebrated with exclamation points but with the acknowledgment of progress, reinforcing the feeling of "leveling up." It's a measured recognition of a goal met, like closing a deal.

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC MODIFIERS (Pick if applicable)

[x] Business Tools - "Optimize", "Scale", "Grow", "ROI", results-focused

Rationale: The app's value is framed in business terms that resonate with the target audience's professional goals.

COMPLEXITY HANDLING (Pick 1)

[x] Progressive Disclosure - Simple first, details on demand

Rationale: The app must provide an at-a-glance executive dashboard. Users can trust that the top-level information is what matters, with the option to drill down into detailed analytics when they choose.

Microcopy Guidelines & Content Strategy
The voice of this app is that of a trusted, discreet executive coach. It is calm, confident, and data-driven. It never scolds; it reports. It doesn't restrict; it creates opportunities for focus.

Core Microcopy Principles:

Frame Restriction as Intention: Never use punitive language. A blocked app isn't "locked" or "banned." The user has entered a "Focus Mode," "Initiated a Lock," or is in a "Deep Work Session." This reframes the entire experience as an act of empowerment and control.

Communicate in Metrics and Value: The user is an operator. Speak their language. Time blocked isn't just "time away from Instagram"; it's "+1.5h of Focused Time" or "2 Cognitive Insights Unlocked." Quantify the benefits to reinforce the feeling of achievement.

Respect Intelligence, Guide to Action: Assume the user is smart but busy. Get to the point quickly. Use clear headers and concise body copy. Every screen, especially empty states and onboarding, should end with a clear, logical next step.

Voice in Action: Examples

For the Block Intervention Screen:

Headline: Focus Mode Active

Body: You've initiated a Focus Lock on Instagram to achieve your deep work goals. Access can be regained by completing a strategic insight.

CTA: Begin 3-Min Insight

For Empty States (e.g., First use of the Dashboard):

Headline: Your Productivity Baseline

Body: Your focus metrics and learning ROI will appear here once you complete your first Focus Mode session.

CTA: Set Your First Focus Lock

For Success States (e.g., Completing a focus session):

Toast Notification: Focus Session Complete. +2h added to your weekly goal.

Dashboard Update: A new card appears: Achievement Unlocked: 5 Hours of Deep Work this week.

For Loading States:

Use progressive, specific language.

Instead of Loading..., use Calculating focus metrics... or Curating your next insight..
